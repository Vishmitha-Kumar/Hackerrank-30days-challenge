Given a base- integer, , convert it to binary (base-). Then find and print the base- integer denoting the maximum number of consecutive 's in 's binary representation. When working with different bases, it is common to show the base as a subscript.

Example

The binary representation of  is . In base , there are  and  consecutive ones in two groups. Print the maximum, .

Input Format

A single integer, .

Constraints

Output Format

Print a single base- integer that denotes the maximum number of consecutive 's in the binary representation of n.

CODE:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {

    int n;
    cin >> n;

    int sum = 0;
    int max = 0;

    while (n > 0) {
        if (n % 2 == 1)
         {
            sum++;
            if (sum > max) 
            max = sum;
          }  
        else 
        sum = 0;
        
        n = n / 2;
    }
    cout << max;
    return 0;
